This project aims to predict car prices in the American market using a variety of regression models. The dataset, which contains various car attributes, was provided to analyze the factors influencing car pricing. The project includes several steps, including loading and preprocessing the data, implementing five different regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Support Vector Regressor), evaluating the models, analyzing feature importance, and performing hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance. The key evaluation metrics used are R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

The goal of this project is to provide the automobile company with insights into how different variables (e.g., horsepower, car model, year, etc.) affect car prices and to identify the most effective model for predicting prices. The feature importance analysis helps in understanding which features have the greatest impact on the target variable, while hyperparameter tuning ensures that the best model is chosen. The project is implemented using Python, with libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib for data manipulation, model building, and visualization. The final results will allow the company to strategize effectively based on the pricing dynamics of the American market.
